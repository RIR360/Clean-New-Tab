## About
This extension project shows you the use of JavaScript local storage. Using that I taught JavaScript to run a function only once a day. That way the extension will know which link you've visited on a particular day.

In order to try this extension, you don't have to install it on your browser. You can find the source code in the GitHub repository below. 

It's not packed for real chrome extension because the normal users can't add any link or any image to the page. That's obviously a feature I want to implement in the future.
